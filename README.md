As a web developer, I began working on this project while I was studying.
I utilized a Gulp-based collector for the frontend and the Django framework for the backend.
To store information about products, I utilized a SQLite database.

Although the project remains unfinished, it provided me with valuable experience
in utilizing modern web development technologies and frameworks.
During the course of the project, I applied my knowledge of frontend development
to implement the Gulp-based collector, which streamlined the process of managing the project's various assets.
Additionally, I utilized Django, a highly efficient and scalable framework, to develop
the backend, which provided a robust foundation for the project.

I chose SQLite to manage the project's data because it offers
an efficient and lightweight solution for small-scale applications such as this.

Overall, this project serves as a testament to my skills and demonstrates
my ability to manage complex projects while utilizing modern technologies and frameworks.
While I was unable to complete it due to a change in my educational direction,
the knowledge and experience I gained from working on this
project have been invaluable to my growth as a developer.
